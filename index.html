		  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
		    <p>Hi my name is William Edward Thompson Jr, or Will for short. I never really have been good at talking about myself or my life. So lets go down the timeline highlighting some big things.
			Through out my short life experiance i've dealt with a few hardships and struggles. My mother passed when I was 4 years old. Which left a single dad trying to work and take care of a kid.
			Despite not having the best of starts I was lucky enough to have a great mentor living in the same household. My father, who would steer me towards the right path.</p>

		<h2>Youth Years</h2>
		    <p>I was born the youngest sibling in my group of 3 including me, my brother and my sister. Both of which have a different mother or father. 
			This made it weird between us early growing up, I barely knew them because they didnt live with me. I grew up born and raised in Washington otherwise known as the Evergreen State.</p>

		<h2> Middle & Highschool </h2>
		    <p>I was one of about 200 kids of the K.M.T.A (Kent.Merdian.Techonology.Academy).Which basically means I was in the same classes with those group of people for 4 years were I made some really close friends.
                       I played a lot more basketball, started to take it semi-seriously. I also decided to stop wrestling and focus on other areas of my life. </p>
